# javascript.info-course
This is my repository for storing my files for javascript.info's course!
I'll try to add the URL to the exercise and add a commented out version of the task prior to my solutions.

I get to solidify my git skills, learn JavaScript, and do some markdown because I am also posting updates to dev.to about my journey into learning JavaScript.  Feel free to follow me on there as well https://dev.to/pantsme
